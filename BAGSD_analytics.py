'''
Commenting:

* intended to be a wrapper class to make analytics and return macroscopic values and shoes it in the graphix
* only gets implemented if i find the time since its nice to have but not necessary

* calculations of return values should be implemented in sub modules
* calculation of visual representaton should be calculated in a sub module ( return as a sub plot???)
